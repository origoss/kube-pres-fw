## On Tech Predictions

### Three Epic Fails:
1. There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.\
*Ken Olsen, Founder of DEC, 1977.*
2. There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant\
market share.\
*Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, 2007.*
3. The subscription model of buying music is bankrupt. I think you\
could make available the Second Coming in a subscription model\
and it might not be successful.\
*Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, 2003.*

## On Tech Predictions

### Three Bold Successes:
1. The number of transistors incorporated in a chip will\
approximately double every 24 months.\
*Gordon Moore, Co-founder of Intel, 1965.*
2. The vision of 'the network is the computer' is not just a slogan;\
it's a reality that will shape the future of computing.\
*John Gage, Chief Scientist at Sun Microsystems, 1984.*
3. When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be\
converted into a huge brain.\
*Nikola Tesla, Inventor, 1926.*

## Frameworks for Tech Forecasting
1. **The S-Curve & The Gartner Hype Cycle**
   * Technology adoption is not linear. It follows a predictable "S" curve\
     from innovators to the late majority.
   * The Hype Cycle is a famous model of this: showing the\
     *Peak of Inflated Expectations* and the *Trough of Disillusionment*\
     before a technology finds real productivity.
2. **Scenario Planning**
   * Instead of predicting a single future, create multiple\
     plausible scenarios (an optimistic, a pessimistic, and a "weird" one).
3. **Incentive & Ecosystem Analysis**
   * *Follow the money.* Analyze the economic and strategic incentives\
     of the major players.

## The Kelsey Method
* If in doubt about Kubernetes, ask Kelsey Hightower.
* *The future of Kubernetes is no Kubernetes*

## The Gabor Denes Method

**The future cannot be predicted,
but futures can be invented.**

## Astrology
### Career

Kubernetes, You like to avoid office politics and refuse\
to fight against others for coveted positions in industry.\
Find situations where you can work alone, do your own thing,\
and work at your own pace, such as writing, painting,\
computer programming and so on.

---

## Astrology
### Finance

In financial matters, you would have weight and authority.\
You will be successful in carrying out your plans if not hampered\
by **partners**. So, as far as possible, **avoid partnership businesses**.\
You have to work very hard against many disadvantages during your early\
years. In spite of this, you may expect to gain a considerable amount of\
**financial success**, also position and prominence due to your own\
**superior mentality**, not dependent on what is called luck or chance.

## How accurately could we have predicted\
today's Kubernetes in 2015?

* What we knew in **2015**:
  * v1.0 just launched
  * focus on basic container orchestration (Pods, Services, etc.).
* What we didn't foresee:
  * service mesh (Istio/Envoy/Linkerd, **2016–2017**)
  * CRDs (**2017**);
  * GitOps (term **2017**)
  * serverless Knative (**2018**)
  * eBPF in cloud native (**2019–2021**)
  * Platform Engineering/IDPs (**2021–2023**)

## Kubernetes as a Distributed OS

- Kubernetes provides core OS functions, but for a distributed\
cluster of machines.
- It abstracts infrastructure, creating a unified platform for applications.

| Operating System Function | Kubernetes Equivalent                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Hardware Abstraction      | Abstracts nodes into a single compute pool   |
| Resource Management       | Manages CPU/memory with requests & limits    |
| Process Management        | Manages container lifecycle (like processes) |
| Networking                | Provides cluster-wide pod networking         |
| Storage Management        | Orchestrates persistent data with PVs/PVCs   |
| Security & Isolation      | Isolates workloads via namespaces/policies   |

## OS equivalent of Kubernetes?

Maybe Linux?

- Open-source licensing
- Community driven development
- Community driven decision-making (SIGs)
- Linux foundation
- Distribution model

## History of Linux


- **1991**: Linux created by Linus Torvalds as a free,\
open-source kernel, starting its path to\
server adoption
- **1992**: Kernel released publicly, enabling global\
collaboration and server-focused development
- **2001**: Linux server shipments grew 15% annually,\
showing rising enterprise trust
- **2004**: Powered ~50% of global server blade\
units, marking data center dominance
- **2025**: Runs on 78.3% of web-facing servers\
worldwide, reflecting broad, vendor-independent\
acceptance

## The *Winner-Takes-Most* Model

- A dominant standard emerges from a feedback loop of adoption,\
  ecosystem growth, and high switching costs.
- Why?
  - Network effect
  - Positive feedback loop
  - Competitive moat
    - Brand strength
    - Patents or IP protection
    - Cost advantages
    - Switching cost

## Predictions based on WTM model

1. Kubernetes becomes an increasingly invisible, foundational layer.\
   The goal is to not interact with it directly.
2. The vast ecosystem is more important than core features for \
   long-term dominance.
3. The next *big thing* will be built *on top of* Kubernetes,\
   not replace it.
4. Innovation shifts from the core orchestrator to the platforms\
   and developer experiences built upon it.

## What about the *runtimes* of Kubernetes?
