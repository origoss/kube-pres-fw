and how to think about uncertainty

## On Tech Predictions

### Three Epic Fails:
1. There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.\
*Ken Olsen, Founder of DEC, 1977.*
2. There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant\
market share.\
*Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, 2007.*
3. The subscription model of buying music is bankrupt. I think you\
could make available the Second Coming in a subscription model\
and it might not be successful.\
*Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, 2003.*

## On Tech Predictions

### Three Bold Successes:
1. The number of transistors incorporated in a chip will\
approximately double every 24 months.\
*Gordon Moore, Co-founder of Intel, 1965.*
2. The vision of 'the network is the computer' is not just a slogan;\
it's a reality that will shape the future of computing.\
*John Gage, Chief Scientist at Sun Microsystems, 1984.*
3. When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be\
converted into a huge brain.\
*Nikola Tesla, Inventor, 1926.*

## Frameworks for Tech Forecasting
1. **The S-Curve & The Gartner Hype Cycle**
   * Technology adoption is not linear. It follows a predictable "S" curve\
     from innovators to the late majority.
   * The Hype Cycle is a famous model of this: showing the\
     *Peak of Inflated Expectations* and the *Trough of Disillusionment*\
     before a technology finds real productivity.
2. **Scenario Planning**
   * Instead of predicting a single future, create multiple\
     plausible scenarios (an optimistic, a pessimistic, and a "weird" one).
3. **Incentive & Ecosystem Analysis**
   * *Follow the money.* Analyze the economic and strategic incentives\
     of the major players.
   * A technology's success is often determined more by its ecosystem\
     than its features.

## The Kelsey Method
* If in doubt about Kubernetes, ask Kelsey Hightower.
* *The future of Kubernetes is no Kubernetes*

# Crystal Images

## Interactive Elements

Add crystal images that shatter to reveal photos:

```

# Multi-Line
Titles Are Here!

## Using Backslash \
For Line Breaks

End a line with **two spaces** or a **backslash** to break titles across multiple lines.

- **More** readable headings
- Better **control** over layout
- Standard **markdown** syntax

## *Italic* Text Support

You can use *italic* text for emphasis:

- *Emphasized* words
- Combined **bold** and *italic* styles
- For *visual* variety
